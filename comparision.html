        <h2>CSS Grid compared to <b style="color: rgb(164, 13, 93);">Flexbox</b> </h2>
        <p>CSS Grid and Flexbox are both layout models in CSS, but they serve different
            purposes and are suitable for different scenarios.
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <div class="comparision-wrapper">
            <p class="comparision-p">
                CSS Grid:
            </p>
            <p class="comparision-p pink-color">
                Flexbox:
            </p>
            <p class="comparision-p p-css-grid">
                1- CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layout, allowing you to
                create both
                rows and columns in a grid structure.
                It's particularly useful for overall page layout where you want
                to define the
                structure of the entire page.

            </p>
            <p class="comparision-p pink-color p-flexbox">
                1- Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layout, either as a row
                or a column.
                Ideal for laying out items in a single direction, such as in
                navigation menus or a list of items.
            </p>
            <p class="comparision-p p-css-grid">
                2- CSS Grid excels at placing items in specific locations on the grid.
                You can control the placement of items both horizontally and vertically 
                with grid lines.
            </p>
            <p class="comparision-p pink-color p-flexbox">
                2- Flexbox is excellent for distributing space along a single axis and
                aligning items within that axis.
                Great for centering items vertically or horizontally within a
                container.
            </p>
            <p class="comparision-p p-css-grid">
                3- CSS Grid is well-suited for complex layouts, especially when dealing with
                large-scale
                designs or when the layout itself has a grid-like structure.
            </p>
            <p class="comparision-p pink-color p-flexbox">
                3- Flexbox is well-suited for handling dynamic content where the size of the
                items may vary.

            </p>
            <p class="comparision-p p-css-grid">
                4- CSS Grid supports both implicit and explicit grid, offering 
                flexibility in defining the size and placement of items.
            </p>
            <p class="comparision-p pink-color p-flexbox">
                4- Flexbox allows you to easily change the order of items in the source
                code without affecting the visual
                layout.

            </p>
            <p class="comparision-p p-css-grid">
                5- CSS Grid makes it easier to create responsive designs as you can define
                different
                grid structures for different screen sizes.
            </p>
            <p class="comparision-p pink-color p-flexbox">
                5- Flexbox is suitable for building flexible and responsive components 
                within a
                larger layout.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Combination</h3>
        <p><b>Often, developers use a combination of both CSS Grid and Flexbox in 
            a project. For example, using CSS Grid for the overall page structure and
             Flexbox for smaller components or items within the grid.</b> </p>

    <!--CSS GRID VS BOOTSTRAP-->
    <main class="comparision-2">
        <h2>CSS Grid compared to <b style="color: rgb(255, 234, 0);">Bootstrap</b> </h2>
        <p>CSS Grid and Bootstrap are tools used in frontend web development, but they 
            serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <div class="comparision-wrapper">
            <p class="comparision-2-p">

            <p class="comparision-2-p p-css-grid-2">
                1- CSS Grid is a native CSS feature, meaning it's a part of the CSS 
                specification itself and doesn't require an external library or framework.

            </p>
            <p class="comparision-2-p yellow-color p-bootstrap">
                1- Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that includes a set of pre-designed 
                components and a responsive grid system to streamline web development.
            </p>
            <p class="comparision-2-p p-css-grid-2">
                2- CSS Grid is designed for creating two-dimensional layouts with both 
                rows and columns, providing precise control over the placement of items.
            </p>
            <p class="comparision-2-p yellow-color p-bootstrap">
                2- Bootstrap uses a 12-column grid system, providing a simple and 
                responsive layout structure. It is primarily designed for one-dimensional
                 layouts.
            </p>
            <p class="comparision-2-p p-css-grid-2">
                3- CSS Grid allows developers to define grid lines and grid areas, 
                making it easy to create complex layouts with clear structure.
            </p>
            <p class="comparision-2-p yellow-color p-bootstrap">
                3- Beyond layout, Bootstrap includes a collection of pre-styled UI 
                components like buttons, navigation bars, forms, and more.

            </p>
            <p class="comparision-2-p p-css-grid-2">
                4- CSS Grid offers powerful features for building responsive designs, 
                allowing developers to adapt the layout based on different screen sizes.
            </p>
            <p class="comparision-2-p yellow-color p-bootstrap">
                4- Bootstrap is often favored for rapid prototyping and development, 
                as it comes with a standardized set of components that can be easily 
                customized.
            </p>
            <p class="comparision-2-p p-css-grid-2">
                5- CSS Grid Supports both explicit and implicit grid, providing 
                flexibility in defining the size and placement of items within the grid.
            </p>
            <p class="comparision-2-p yellow-color p-bootstrap">
                5- While Bootstrap offers convenience, it may provide less control 
                over the fine details of layout compared to CSS Grid. Developers need
                 to adhere to the framework's conventions.
